To master Java and work effectively on large-scale projects, here’s a curated learning plan broken into stages:

---

### **Stage 1: Core Java Fundamentals (1 Month)**
Focus on building a strong foundation.

1. **Java Basics**:
   - Data types, variables, operators, control structures (loops, if-else, switch).
   - Arrays, Strings, StringBuilder, StringBuffer.

2. **OOP Concepts**:
   - Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
   - Access modifiers and constructors.

3. **Collections Framework**:
   - Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList), Sets (HashSet, TreeSet), Maps (HashMap, TreeMap).
   - Queue, Stack, and Iterators.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - try-catch-finally, custom exceptions.

5. **Input/Output (I/O)**:
   - File handling, Streams, Serialization, Deserialization.

6. **Java 8+ Features**:
   - Functional Interfaces, Streams API, Lambda expressions.
   - Default and static methods in interfaces.

---

### **Stage 2: Advanced Java (1.5 Months)**
Deep dive into frameworks and advanced concepts.

1. **Multithreading and Concurrency**:
   - Thread lifecycle, Runnable, Callable, Executors.
   - Synchronization, Locks, Deadlocks, Java Concurrency utilities.

2. **Generics and Annotations**:
   - Type-safe programming with Generics.
   - Built-in and custom annotations.

3. **JDBC and Database Connectivity**:
   - Connect Java applications to relational databases.
   - Transactions, connection pooling.

4. **Java Reflection**:
   - Inspect and modify runtime behavior of applications.

5. **Serialization and Deserialization**:
   - ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream.

6. **Java Networking**:
   - Sockets, ServerSocket, HTTP communication.

### **Stage 3: Build Expertise with Spring Framework (2 Months)**
Spring is essential for modern Java projects.

1. **Spring Core**:
   - Dependency Injection (DI), Inversion of Control (IoC).
   - Spring Bean lifecycle, Profiles, Properties.

2. **Spring Boot**:
   - Building RESTful APIs, Spring Boot Annotations.
   - Configuration, Auto-configuration, and Actuator.

3. **Spring Data JPA**:
   - ORM with Hibernate, CRUD operations.
   - JPQL, Criteria API, Entity relationships.

4. **Spring Security**:
   - Authentication and Authorization.
   - Role-based access, OAuth2, JWT.

5. **Spring Batch**:
   - Batch processing concepts.
   - Jobs, Steps, Readers, Writers.

6. **Spring Cache**:
   - Cache abstraction and integration with applications.

---

### **Stage 4: System Design and Architecture (2 Months)**
Learn how to handle large-scale applications.

1. **Design Patterns**:
   - Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, Proxy.
   - MVC, DAO, and Repository patterns.

2. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Building and deploying microservices.
   - Communication with REST/HTTP, gRPC, and Event-driven architecture.

3. **API Development**:
   - RESTful APIs, OpenAPI/Swagger, API versioning.

4. **Database Design**:
   - Designing scalable and optimized databases.
   - Normalization, Indexing, Query Optimization.

5. **Distributed Systems**:
   - Understanding CAP theorem, consistency, availability, partition tolerance.
   - Tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ.

6. **Testing**:
   - JUnit, Mockito for unit testing.
   - Integration and end-to-end testing with Spring Test.

---

### **Stage 5: Project Development (2 Months)**
Apply what you’ve learned to build real-world applications.

1. **Small Projects**:
   - Blog application with CRUD operations.
   - Task management system with user roles and permissions.

2. **Capstone Project**:
   - E-commerce platform:
     - User management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing.
     - Payment gateway integration, logging, monitoring.
     - Scalability using microservices.

---

### **Stage 6: Performance and Scalability (1 Month)**
Learn to handle large-scale production environments.

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - JVM internals, Garbage Collection tuning.
   - Profiling and monitoring tools (JProfiler, VisualVM).

2. **Scalability Techniques**:
   - Caching, Load balancing, Asynchronous processing.
   - Database sharding, horizontal scaling.

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes.
